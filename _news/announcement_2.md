On December 15th, 2021, the First Workshop on Cyber Ethics in Platial Research took place virtually in Enschede, the Netherlands, as part of the Third International Symposium on Platial Information Science (PLATIAL’21). The workshop focused on exploring ethical considerations related to place. I had the privilege of organizing and chairing the workshop, and the report has been recently published as part of the PLATIAL’21 symposium proceedings.
