The 71st annual meeting and conference of the <a href=" https://www.cag-acg.ca/">Canadian Association of Geographers (CAG)</a> will be held virtually from June 7 to 11. Hosted by the University of Northern British Columbia, the conference will be entirely online. I'll be co-organizing three geospatial data science sessions at the conference. If your work aligns with this theme, we welcome your submissions. The deadline for papers/abstracts submission is March 26th. More details on the sessions below. 
***
<h2>1. Lightning Talks (3-5 minute presentations [question period at the end])</h2>
We are inviting research presentations for this lightning talks session on a variety of geospatial data science topics. Each lightning talk will be a maximum of five minutes long. Lightning talks are an excellent way to share progress and preliminary results of research involving geospatial data and methods. We strongly encourage work-in-progress submissions from researchers at all levels.  This is an excellent opportunity to get feedback on emerging research ideas.
<h2>2. Paper Presentations (fifteen-minute presentations [10+5])</h2>
We are soliciting research paper presentations on topics that involve geographic information science and data science applied or theoretical problems or methodologies. We encourage submissions involving research at the intersection of data science and geographical information science. We aim to showcase how geospatial data and computational methods are being used across the range of applications encountered in geographical research.
<h2>3. Panel Discussion (5 minute intro from each panelist + questions)</h2>
Alongside this special session, we will host a discussion roundtable where we intend to identify common themes, trends, and skillsets encountered by geographers and domain specialists working with geospatial data in different applications within geography. We invite CAG participants to discuss what it means to do geospatial data science based on their own experiences. We are actively seeking a diverse cast of panel members who range in age, career experience, ethnic background and field of study, and as such, we encourage early-career researchers/upper year graduate students, post docs, or assistant professors to participate. The goal is to have an inter-disciplinary and inter-personal discussion surrounding the benefits and challenges of geospatial data science in their own research.
