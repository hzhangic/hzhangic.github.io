<b>Overview:</b>
While geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI), along with big data and high-performance computing facilities, continuously increases the capability of modern geographic information systems, the advancement of computational technologies has also expanded the field of geoethics into a multidisciplinary study area. Among those, geoprivacy is a frequently discussed topic because of the prevalence of the privacy paradox: individuals want to leverage new technology (e.g., making friends through sharing private experiences) and also avoid unwanted consequences (e.g., targeted advertising). In this session, we invite submissions of applied, theoretical, or methods-based research on geoprivacy and geoethics in the context of GeoAI. Potential areas of study may include (but are not limited to):
<ul>
<li>Geoprivacy-aware geospatial data models</li>
<li>Geoprivacy risk assessment and projection methods</li>
<li>Geoprivacy in geo-distributed data centers</li>
<li>Geoprivacy and accuracy of spatial information</li>
<li>The relationship between geoprivacy and geospatial data utility</li>
<li>Multidimensional characteristics of geospatial data utility</li>
<li>Geoprivacy issues of mobility data (e.g., GPS trajectory, cellphone location data)</li>
<li>Citizen science, location-based social networks, and their geoprivacy concerns</li>
<li>Privacy and ethical issues related to COVID-19 contact tracing</li>
<li>Emerging technologies (e.g., blockchain, metaverse) and their privacy and ethical implications</li>
<li>Geosurveillance</li>
<li>Technology and society</li>
<li>Responsible use of spatial data</li>
<li>Fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics in GeoAI</li>
</ul>
