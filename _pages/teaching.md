GEOGRAPH 491P/691P GIS Programming

<b>Syllabus:</b> <a href="../assets/pdf/GEOG_491P_691P_GIS_Programming_Syllabus_0831.pdf">Fall 2024</a>

<b>Course description:</b> This course will cover a number of programming methods and applications in GIS. Beginning in the (familiar) ArcGIS environment, this course will explore fundamentals of
programming in Python while learning the Model Builder interface. By exploring basic automation methods of repetitive or complex tasks, this course will also introduce foundations of computer science and computational thinking. While gaining proficiency in Model Builder, this course will expand to other python scripting applications, both within ArcGIS and on other platforms. By exploring many applications of programming to advance GIS analysis and improve workflows, students will build a strong base of knowledge and capacity for future learning and flexibility with programming in GIS.

<b>Syllabus:</b> <a href="../assets/pdf/GEOG264_course_outline_F2023_Sept1.pdf">Fall 2023</a>

<b>Calendar description:</b> This course is an introduction to the fundamentals of computer programming relevant for environmental sciences. It presents the basic building blocks of computer programming, including data types, variables and constants; expressions and operators; assignments, control structures, simple library functions and programmer‑defined functions. Students learn how to develop algorithms and how to convert algorithms/pseudo codes into a programming language — specific syntax (e.g. R, Python) — to collect, query, preprocess, visualize and analyze environmental datasets.
