I then worked as an Engineering Support Specialist at <a href="https://www.geotab.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Geotab</a>, troubleshooting telematics hardware and software to enhance the customer experience. Now, pursuing my doctoral degree under the guidance of <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/geography/mckenzie" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Grant McKenzie</a> at McGill University, I explore the fields of behavioural geography, spatial data science, and privacy.</p> </body></html>
