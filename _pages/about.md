After obtaining my B.E.S. in Geomatics from the University of Waterloo, I pursued my passion for GIScience by successfully completing my M.Sc. at Western University under the supervision of [Jacek Malczewski](https://geoenvironment.uwo.ca/people/faculty/malczewski_jacek.html). I then worked as an Engineering Support Specialist at [Geotab](https://www.geotab.com/), troubleshooting telematics hardware and software to enhance the customer experience. Now, pursuing my doctoral degree under the guidance of [Grant McKenzie](https://www.mcgill.ca/geography/mckenzie) at McGill University, I explore the fields of behavioural geography, spatial data science, and privacy. As an experienced researcher and instructor with a proven track record in the information technology and services industry, I am proficient in ArcGIS, Python, SQL, and technical support.
