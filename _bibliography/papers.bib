  abstract = {Traditional boundaries between people are vanishing due to the rise of Internet of Things technology. Our smart devices keep us connected to the world, but also monitor our daily lives through an unprecedented amount data collection. As a result, defining privacy has become more complicated. Individuals want to leverage new technology (e.g., making friends through sharing private experiences) and also avoid unwanted consequences (e.g., targeted advertising). In the age of ubiquitous digital content, geoprivacy is unique because concerns in this area are constantly changing and context-dependent. Multiple factors influence people’s location disclosure decisions, including time, culture, demographics, spatial granularity, and trust. Existing research primarily focuses on the computational efforts of protecting geoprivacy, while the variation of geoprivacy perceptions has yet to receive adequate attention in the data science literature. In this work, we explore geoprivacy from a cognate-based perspective and tackle our changing perception of the concept from multiple angles. Our objectives are to rehumanize this field from contextual, cultural, and economic dimensions and highlight the uniqueness of geodata under the broad topic of privacy. It is essential that we understand the spatial variations of geoprivacy perceptions in the era of big data. Masking geographic coordinates can no longer fully anonymize spatial data, and targeted geoprivacy protection needs to be further investigated to improve user experience.},

  abstract = {Concern over the privacy of our personal location is at an all-time high, yet the desire to share our lives with friends, family, and the public persists. Current methods and applications for sharing location content with the range of people in our lives are sorely lacking. Application users are often limited to sharing a single spatial resolution with all individuals, regardless of relation, and with little control over how this content is shared. Processes for sharing typically involve allowing a for-profit company access to one’s location before it can be transmitted to the intended recipient. In this work we propose a set of design goals and a design pattern for sharing personal location information that are realized through a prototype mobile web application. Our approach is built on the novel idea of obfuscated and encrypted location views, and promotes a uniquely open method for sharing. The intention of this article is to demonstrate that location sharing need not require one to expose private location information to third parties, and that methods exist to put an individual back in control of their content.},

  abstract = {Volunteered geographic information (VGI) has been applied in many fields such as participatory planning, humanitarian relief and crisis management. One of the reasons for popularity of VGI is its cost-effectiveness. However, the coverage and accuracy of VGI cannot be guaranteed. The issue of geospatial data quality in the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project has become a trending research topic because of the large size of the dataset and the multiple channels of data access. This paper focuses on a national study of the Canadian OSM road network data for the assessment of completeness, positional accuracy, attribute accuracy, semantic accuracy and lineage. The OSM road networks in Canada have generally reliable quality compared to Digital Mapping Technologies Inc. Urban areas and footways received more contributions than rural areas and motorways, and imported road segments from GeoBase have slightly better quality than the national OSM dataset. The findings of the map quality can potentially guide cartographic product selection for interested parties and offer a better understanding of future improvement of OSM quality. In addition, the study presents the OSM contributions influenced by data import and remote mapping.},

  abstract = {Any advancement in technology is accompanied by new concerns over its ethical use and impacts on privacy. While a notoriously difficult term to define, privacy as it relates to technology usage, can be described as the ability of an individual or group to control their personal information. Like many ethical concepts, this definition evolves with changes in societal and technical norms. The emergence of machine learning and related artificial intelligence techniques has again shifted societal concerns about the privacy of our persons, socio-demographic group membership, and personal data. Location data are particularly sensitive as they link information across sources and can be used to infer a wide variety of personal information. This makes data privacy one of the most important ethical discussions within the field of geographic artificial intelligence (GeoAI). The main objective of this chapter is to explore the unique privacy concerns associated with AI techniques used for analyzing geospatial information. After providing an overview of the topic, we describe some of the most common techniques and leading application areas through which data privacy and GeoAI are converging. Finally, we suggest a number of ways that privacy within GeoAI can improve and highlight emerging topics within the field.},

  abstract = {A large amount of crowd-sourced geospatial data have been created in recent years due to the interactivity of Web 2.0 and the availability of Global Positioning System (GPS). This geo-information is typically referred to as volunteered geographic information (VGI). OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a popular VGI platform that allows users to create or edit maps using GPS-enabled devices or aerial imageries. The issue of quality of geo-information generated by OSM has become a trending research topic because of the large size of the dataset and the inapplicability of Linus' Law in a geospatial context. This chapter systematically reviews the quality evaluation process of OSM, and demonstrates a case study of London, Canada for the assessment of completeness, positional accuracy and attribute accuracy. The findings of the quality evaluation can potentially serve as a guide of cartographic product selection and provide a better understanding of the development of OSM quality over geographic space and time.},

  abstract = {While it is increasingly necessary in today’s digital society, sharing personal location information comes at a cost. Sharing one’s precise place of interest, e.g., Compass Coffee, enables a range of location-based services, but substantially reduces the individual’s privacy. Methods have been developed to obfuscate and anonymize location data while still maintaining a degree of utility. One such approach, spatial k-anonymity, aims to ensure an individual’s level of anonymity by reporting their location as a set of k potential locations rather than their actual location alone. Larger values of k increase spatial anonymity while decreasing the utility of the location information. Typical examples of spatial k-anonymized datasets present elements as simple geographic points with no attributes or contextual information. In this work, we demonstrate that the addition of publicly available contextual data can significantly reduce the anonymity of a k-anonymized dataset. Through the analysis of place type temporal visitation patterns, hours of operation, and popularity values, one’s anonymity can be decreased by more than 50 percent. We propose a platial k-anonymity approach that leverages a combination of temporal popularity signatures and reports the amount that k must increase in order to maintain a certain level of anonymity. Finally, a method for reporting platial k-anonymous regions is presented and the implications of our methods are discussed.},

In this work, we analyze users' reactions to this implementation. Exploratory spatial-temporal analysis was conducted on a wide range of content with the goal of understanding the general trends and major themes of the discussion. A Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model was used to extract implicit topics from the discourse. Results indicate that both supporters and opponents of the mandatory location disclosure participated in the discussion, with females more involved than males. Location privacy concerns were also interpreted through hashtags and LDA-derived topics, and the variation between local and overseas Chinese opinions was compared. The findings of this study will aid policymakers in understanding public concerns about mandatory location disclosure and help developers implement privacy-aware designs in the context of contemporary China.},

Next, a national study of the Canadian OSM data assesses the overall semantic accuracy and lineage in addition to the quality measures mentioned above. Results of the quality evaluation are compared with associated OSM provenance metadata to examine potential correlations. The Canadian OSM road networks were found to have comparable accuracy with the tested commercial database (DMTI). Although statistical analysis suggests that there are no significant relations between OSM accuracy and its editing history, the study presents the complex processes behind OSM contributions possibly influenced by data import and remote mapping. The findings of this thesis can potentially guide cartographic product selection for interested parties and offer a better understanding of future quality improvement in OSM.},
